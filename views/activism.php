echo "<p> <font color=black font face='gadugi' size='5pt'>Taylor Swift has always been an advocate against misogyny. Her songs like, 'The Man', preach 
        feminism to her audience. One lyric included the line, 
        <i>'I'm so sick of running as fast as I can, wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man.'</i> 
        Taylor Swift is constantly sticking up for women around the world and fighting against female 
        stereotypes both with her music, and with her actions.</font> </p>";

        echo "<p> <font color=black font face='gadugi' size='5pt'>A lot of Taylor Swift's songs fight for feminism in the midst of a realtionship or break-ups. In her song, 
        'Tolerate It,' Taylor depicts a relationship where the woman is not appreciated but everything is expected 
        from her. She sings, 
        <i>'I know my love should be celebrated, but you tolerate it'</i>. 
        Taylor is an ally against domestic misogyny just as much as cultural misogyny.</font> </p>";

 echo "<h2> <font color=black font face='gadugi' size='7pt'>LGBTQ Pride</font> </h2>";

echo "<p> <font color=black font face='gadugi' size='5pt'>In her hit song, 'You Need To Calm Down,' Taylor Swift advocates for LGBTQ+ rights and is an ally for gay pride. 
        She stated in an interview with The Guardian that she felt she needed to stand up for those whose rights are 
        being stripped away in front of the world's eyes. She explained that if you are not a white cis-male, 
        then you do not have sustainable rights in this society. One of the lyrics from 'You Need To Calm Down,' said 
     
      <i>'Sunshine on the street at the parade
      But you would rather be in the dark ages
      Making that sign, must've taken all night
      You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
      And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
      'Cause shade never made anybody less gay so'</i></font> </p>";
     
 echo "<p> <font color=black font face='gadugi' size='5pt'>Even though she is not part of the LGBTQ+ community, she realized that she could still use her voice and stand up for that community.</i></font> </p>";

echo "<h2> <font color=black font face='gadugi' size='7pt'>2020 Election</font> </h2>";

        echo "<p> <font color=black font face='gadugi' size='5pt'>During the 2020 election, Taylor Swift spoke out against former president, Donald Trump. 
        She felt that endorsing President Joe Biden in the election was a call to action for her fans. 
        She made an instagram post, see right, where she broke her political silence. 
        Taylor stated that it was important for Americans to cast their votes because the rights of marginalized 
        people were being threatened. She was not sure in the past if she should speak out about her political beliefs, 
        but in lieu of the events that took place between 2016 and 2020, she realized that now was her time to take a stand.</font> </p>";
